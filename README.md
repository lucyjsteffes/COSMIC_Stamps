# COSMIC_Stamps

This is the repository for all of the work that I am doing to analyze the waterfall plots of potentially interesting COSMIC hits. I am getting these stamps files from the hits that my pipeline ARTISTIC flags as being potentially interesting. This has two purposes. The first is to try to find a COSMIC candidate. The second is to assess the quality of the hits flagged by ARTISTIC as being anomalous. I'll add more to the README.md a little later with all of the useful links and better descriptions of the files and packages used.
